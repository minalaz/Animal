# Animal
Assignment17 for homework on IT bootcamp course/Task1:

- Make an abstract class that will represent an Animal. The animal should have a name, nickname and an abstract method that represents the sound the animal makes. Make classes Dog and Cat that inherit Animal. Dog has an additional attribute boolean goodBoy and a method that prints "I am a good boy" or "I am a bad boy" depending on whether the variable goodBoy is true or false. Cat has an attribute for weight and a method that prints "I'm a chonk" or "I'm not a chonk" depending on whether the weight is over 5kg. In both classes implement toString, where in both cases it prints the name and nickname. In the class cat add to toString to print also whether it is chonk or not, and in the class dog whether it is good boy or not (in both cases by calling the specific method). In the concrete classes implement the method for the sound the animal makes, for cat to return String "meow" and for dog "woof". Add a call to that method in toString. In the main method make several cats and dogs. Put them in a list and go through all the elements in a loop, for dogs print "dog: " and add from Dog toString and if it is a cat write "cat: " and also toString. For this use instanceOf.
